# RouteNote

**Save your favourite places offline. Sync them to your private Google Drive.**

RouteNote is an **offline-first, zero-backend** Flutter app for Android and iOS.
It saves GPS locations locally on the device (Hive), backs them up to the user's
*private* Google Drive app-data folder, and delegates turn-by-turn navigation to
Google Maps or Waze via deep links.

No Firebase. No custom server. No database to operate. Your data is yours.

## Overview

RouteNote solves a simple problem: remembering places (a parking spot, a trailhead,
a friend's building) without depending on a third-party account or a backend you
have to pay for and maintain.

- **Local-first.** Every place lives on the device in a Hive database. The app is
  fully usable with no network and no sign-in.
- **Private cloud backup.** Optional Google Sign-In grants exactly one scope,
  `drive.appdata`, which exposes only the app's *own hidden* Drive folder. The
  user's documents, photos, and other Drive files are never visible to the app.
- **Zero backend.** There is no server to host, no auth server, and no analytics.
  OAuth happens directly between the app and Google; the backup is a single JSON
  file in the user's Drive.
- **Bilingual.** Full English / Arabic UI, no hardcoded strings.

## Design principles (strict rules)

These are non-negotiable constraints for the project:

1. **Zero external backend.** No Firebase, AWS, or any custom backend servers for
   database storage.
2. **Offline-first.** All data is saved locally on the device using a fast local
   database (`Hive`). The app is fully functional with no network.
3. **Cloud sync, the "WhatsApp model".** Backup and cross-device sync serialise
   the local database into a JSON file that is synced silently to the user's
   Google Drive, using the hidden `drive.appdata` scope for app-specific
   storage. There is no bespoke sync service.
4. **Bilingual by construction.** The UI supports **Arabic (`ar`)** and
   **English (`en`)** natively via `flutter_localizations` and `.arb` files. UI
   strings are never hardcoded.
5. **Navigation is delegated.** The app ships no turn-by-turn navigation engine;
   it sends coordinates to Google Maps or Waze through intents / deep links
   (`url_launcher`).

## Zero-backend architecture (Google Drive sync)

The app is a self-contained client. The only external service is Google (OAuth +
Drive API), and it is used purely as a personal, private file store.

There is **no** application server, API gateway, or database host. The "backend"
is the operating system's local storage plus the user's own Google Drive.

## Features

- 📍 Save the current GPS location with a name and notes.
- 💾 Fully offline-first — all data lives in a local Hive database.
- ☁️ One-tap backup/sync to the user's **private** Google Drive app-data folder.
- 🔒 Only the `drive.appdata` scope is ever requested.
- 🔁 Automatic sync on app open (once signed in), on app resume (throttled), and a
  24-hour periodic background backup aligned to midnight.
- ♻️ Automatic restore on a fresh device: when the local database is empty and a
  backup exists, it is pulled down automatically.
- 🧭 Navigation delegated to Google Maps / Waze via deep links — no in-app maps.
- 🌐 Arabic / English UI (`flutter_localizations` + ARB files).
- 🌗 Light & dark themes.

## User flow

1. **Capture location (one tap).** The user opens the app and presses the FAB.
   The app grabs the exact GPS coordinates; the user adds a **Name** and
   **Notes**, and the place is saved to the local database.
2. **Search & retrieve.** Saved places are listed newest-first and can be
   filtered with the search bar.
3. **Navigate.** Tapping a place opens its detail screen; **Navigate** hands the
   coordinates to Google Maps (or Waze) for routing.
4. **Auto-sync.** On sign-in / app open / resume, the local JSON overrides the
   Google Drive JSON backup.
5. **Restore.** Signing in on a new device (with an empty local database) fetches
   the JSON from Drive and populates the local database.

## How sync works

The device copy is **always the source of truth**; the Drive file is only a
backup. This is a deliberate "device wins" policy (chosen over timestamp merging
to avoid conflict resolution complexity).

`SyncRepository.syncNow()`:

1. If local data is **non-empty** → upload it, overwriting
   `routenote_backup.json` in Drive.
2. If local data is **empty** and a backup exists → download and restore it into
   the local database (used when installing on a new phone).
3. If not signed in → the sync is skipped silently.

Syncs are triggered:

- when a Google session is restored on app open;
- when the app returns to the foreground (`AppLifecycleState.resumed`), throttled
  to at most once per minute;
- by a `workmanager` periodic task every 24 hours, first scheduled for the next
  midnight. The task runs in a separate background isolate and re-initialises
  Hive itself (`backgroundSyncDispatcher`).

A manual **Restore from Google Drive** action is also available in Settings (with
a confirmation dialog).

## Backup format

A single JSON file (`routenote_backup.json`) in the app-specific Drive folder:

```json
{
  "last_synced": "2026-10-09T12:00:00Z",
  "places": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-v4",
      "name": "Cairo Tower",
      "notes": "Near the Nile",
      "latitude": 30.0444,
      "longitude": 31.2357,
      "timestamp": "2026-10-09T11:00:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter 3.44+** on the `stable` channel (`flutter --version`).
- **Android Studio** (for the Android SDK) and/or **Xcode** (iOS, macOS only).
- A **Google Cloud project** to create the OAuth clients and enable the Drive API.
- A physical device or emulator/Simulator.

### 1. Clone and install dependencies

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Gthruworldwide/RouteNote-App.git
cd RouteNote-App
flutter pub get
flutter gen-l10n        # runs automatically on build; explicit here is fine
```

### 2. Enable the Google Drive API

In the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/):

1. Create or select a project.
2. **APIs & Services → Library → “Google Drive API” → Enable.**

### 3. Create OAuth client IDs

**API & Services → Credentials → Create credentials → OAuth client ID.**

| Client type | Purpose | Feeds |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Web application** | `serverClientId` used by `google_sign_in` on **Android** | `GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID` |
| **Android** | Lets Play Services recognise your app (package + SHA-1) | validation only |
| **iOS** | Client for the iOS app (bundle `com.routenote.routenote`) | `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` |

- **Android:** add your signing SHA-1 (`keytool -list -v -keystore ...`) under an
  *Android* OAuth client with package name `com.routenote.routenote`. You can add
  multiple fingerprints (debug **and** release).
- **iOS:** create an *iOS* client with bundle ID `com.routenote.routenote`. The
  reversed client ID
  (`com.googleusercontent.apps.<ios-client-id>`) must be added to
  `ios/Runner/Info.plist` under `CFBundleURLTypes` (see
  [Platform configuration](#platform-configuration)).

> The app requests **only** `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata`.

#### OAuth consent screen (one-time)

1. **APIs & Services → OAuth consent screen.**
2. User type **External** (an “Internal” app only works inside a Workspace you own).
3. **Scopes:** add `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata` (use *Add
   manually* if it is not in the picker).
4. **Test users:** add your Google account(s). While the app is in **Testing**
   status, only these accounts can authorise — enough for personal/MVP use.
5. Publish only when you want to open sign-in to everyone. `drive.appdata` is a
   sensitive scope, so external users may trigger a verification review; as the
   project owner/test user you can authorise without waiting.

### 4. Run

```sh
# Android or iOS — the same client IDs are compiled in for both.
flutter run \
  --dart-define=GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=xxxx.apps.googleusercontent.com \
  --dart-define=GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=yyyy.apps.googleusercontent.com
```

> Without these defines the app still builds and runs fully offline — Google
> sign-in is simply unavailable until real client IDs are supplied.

On Windows there is a helper script (client IDs are public identifiers, not
secrets):

```powershell
.\scripts\run_dev.ps1
# or target a device explicitly:
.\scripts\run_dev.ps1 -d <device-id>
```

### 5. Build for release

```sh
# Android
flutter build apk     --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=... --dart-define=GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=...
flutter build appbundle --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=... --dart-define=GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=...

# iOS (requires macOS + Xcode)
flutter build ios      --release --dart-define=GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID=... --dart-define=GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID=...
```

Regenerate the native launcher icons after changing `assets/app_icon.png`:

```sh
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Configuration reference

All compile-time values live in `lib/src/core/config/app_config.dart` and are
injected with `--dart-define` (never hardcoded):

| `--dart-define` | Required | Where it is used |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GOOGLE_SERVER_CLIENT_ID` | Android (for sign-in) | `serverClientId` in `GoogleSignIn.instance.initialize` |
| `GOOGLE_IOS_CLIENT_ID` | iOS (for sign-in) | `clientId` in `GoogleSignIn.instance.initialize` |

## Localization

- Template locale: English (`lib/l10n/app_en.arb`); Arabic: `lib/l10n/app_ar.arb`.
- Generated sources live in `lib/l10n/generated/` (output configured in
  `l10n.yaml`). No user-facing string is hardcoded — everything goes through
  `AppLocalizations`.

## Quality gates

```sh
flutter analyze     # expected: No issues found!
flutter test        # Hive-backed widget smoke tests
```

## Platform configuration

Already committed — the notes below explain what is in place.

- **Android** (`android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`):
  `INTERNET`, `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`, `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`,
  `RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED`, and a `<queries>` block for the `geo`,
  `google.navigation`, and `https` intents.
- **iOS** (`ios/Runner/Info.plist`): `NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`,
  `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` (`comgooglemaps`, `googlemaps`, `waze`), and
  `CFBundleURLTypes` containing the reversed iOS client ID
  (`com.googleusercontent.apps.<ios-client-id>`) so the OAuth flow can return to
  the app.
- **Application ID / bundle ID:** `com.routenote.routenote` on both platforms.
- **Icons:** generated with `flutter_launcher_icons` from `assets/app_icon.png`.

## Roadmap

RouteNote follows the **project master roadmap**: an offline-first, zero-backend
location-saving and navigation app for Android and iOS.

**Tech requirements.** Flutter (latest stable) · Riverpod · Hive · `geolocator` ·
`url_launcher` · `google_sign_in` + `googleapis` (Drive API v3) ·
`flutter_localizations` + `intl`.

**Delivery phases**

| Phase | Scope | Status |

| **1 — Local-first core** | Riverpod scaffolding, Hive CRUD, Home (search + FAB + empty state), Add Place (name/notes), Place Detail | ✅ Done |
| **2 — Location capture** | `geolocator` with graceful permission handling (granted / denied / disabled / error) | ✅ Done |
| **3 — Navigation delegation** | Google Maps / Waze via `url_launcher` intents only — no in-app turn-by-turn | ✅ Done |
| **4 — Zero-backend sync** | Google Sign-In (v7), Drive v3 `appDataFolder`, device-wins backup/restore, auto-sync on open & resume, 24h background task | ✅ Done |
| **5 — Polish & release** | EN/AR localization, light/dark themes, launcher icons, MIT license, README | ✅ Done |
| **Future** | Optional timestamp-based merge, multi-device conflict UI, import/export, parking shortcut widget | 💡 Ideas |
